    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Considered by some as the pride of Filipino cuisine, Pork Adobo is definitely a favorite among many around the world.<br> 
        For this, we cook pork slices in a perfect mix of soy sauce, vinegar, and garlic to make this savory and sour viand. <br> 
        And I’ve got to say, it’s definitely a great way to introduce the world to what Pinoy cooks can make! But actually,<br> 
         there are other renditions of adobo. Some use chicken, some use a mix of pork and chicken, and some even use seafood.<br> 
          But for this recipe, we’ll be using pork belly. So let’s get cooking!</p>
